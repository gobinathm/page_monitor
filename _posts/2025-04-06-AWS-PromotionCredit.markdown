## AWS Promotional Credit Terms & Conditions
​
####  Last Updated: December 16, 2024

These AWS Promotional Credit Terms and Conditions (these “Terms”) are an agreement between you and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (or its affiliate as noted in Section 13 below) (“AWS,” “your AWS contracting entity,” “us,” “our,” or “we”) and govern your use of any AWS promotional credit (“Promotional Credit”). You must have a valid AWS account to redeem a Promotional Credit code. Capitalized terms used but not defined in these Terms will have the meanings set forth in the AWS Customer Agreement available at http://aws.amazon.com/agreement, or other written agreement with AWS governing your use of AWS services if applicable (the “Agreement”). These Terms apply to all Promotional Credit, regardless of whether you have a valid AWS account when you receive the Promotional Credit. 

1. Promotional Credit will be applied only to offset eligible fees and charges incurred during or following the billing cycle in which you apply the applicable Promotional Credit code to your AWS account.  Promotional Credit will be applied only to the specific Services designated by your AWS contracting entity (collectively, “Eligible Services”). Unless authorized by us, Promotional Credit will not be applied to any fees or charges for Amazon Mechanical Turk, AWS Managed Services, Ineligible AWS Support, AWS Marketplace, AWS Professional Services, AWS Training, AWS Certification, Amazon Route 53 domain name registration or transfer, any Services for mining for cryptocurrency, any other Services as may be designated by your AWS contracting entity, or any upfront fee for any Services such as Savings Plans and Reserved Instances (collectively, “Ineligible Services”). For purposes of this Section 1, “Ineligible AWS Support” means AWS Support (as described on the AWS Site) that is AWS Enterprise Support, AWS Enterprise On-Ramp, AWS Resold Support (AWS Enterprise Support and AWS Enterprise On-Ramp), and AWS Partner-Led Support.

2. Promotional Credit will not be applied to your AWS account until you redeem your Promotional Credit code through the AWS Site or as otherwise disbursed to your AWS account. Each Promotional Credit code can only be redeemed once and only on one AWS account. Promotional Credit may only be redeemed to offset charges pursuant to an invoice for use of any Eligible Services. Your AWS account will be billed for all fees and charges for use of any Eligible Services in excess of the amount of available Promotional Credit.

3. You may not sell, license, rent, or otherwise transfer Promotional Credit. Promotional Credit may be applied only to your own AWS account. The foregoing does not restrict authorized sharing of Promotional Credits within an AWS Organization (as defined in Section 48 of the AWS Service Terms and as described in the AWS Credits section of the AWS Billing User Guide on the AWS Site). Promotional Credit has no intrinsic value, is not redeemable for cash, has no cash value, is nonrefundable, and serves merely as a means to provide an incentive to use our Services. Promotional Credit may not be purchased for cash, and we and our affiliates do not sell Promotional Credit. 

4. Promotional Credit is void in the event of fraud, misuse, or violation of any terms of the Agreement, these Terms, or the terms of the agreement, promotion, or program pursuant to which you received the Promotional Credit. Promotional Credit is void if sold for cash or other consideration. If AWS determines a customer created an AWS account solely for the purpose of obtaining Promotional Credit, any Promotional Credit applied to that AWS account will be void. In addition to any other legal relief available to us, you will reimburse us for the amount of any Promotional Credit you use in violation of these Terms. You will maintain true, complete and accurate records sufficient to verify compliance with these terms, and agree to promptly provide AWS with reasonable documentary evidence of such compliance.

5. By accepting Promotional Credit, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to agree to these Terms on behalf of the entity you represent and that your receipt and use of Promotional Credit is not prohibited or inconsistent with any applicable laws, rules, regulations, or binding orders (including applicable ethics or procurement rules) and will not create a conflict of interest for your AWS contracting entity.

6. Unless authorized by us, Promotional Credit may not be used in conjunction with any other promotional or incentive offer from us or our affiliates.

7. Promotional Credit will not be applied against any sales, use, gross receipts, or similar transaction-based taxes that may be applicable to you.

8. You may not issue any press release or make any other public disclosure regarding Promotional Credit without our prior written consent. In addition, you agree not to misrepresent or embellish the relationship between us and you. For example, you agree not to imply that we support, sponsor, or endorse you unless you have our prior written permission to do so.

9. Promotional Credit is valid for a limited time only and cannot be redeemed after the expiration date indicated when you receive the applicable Promotional Credit code (or such other date designated by us or in these Terms). Redeemed Promotional Credit will be applied to offset eligible fees and charges incurred during the entire billing cycle in which it expires. Failure to redeem Promotional Credit before its expiration date will result in its forfeiture. We reserve the right to cancel Promotional Credit at any time. No refunds will be granted for any expired or cancelled Promotional Credit.

10.

(a) Promotional Credit provided under the Cloud Credits for Nonprofits Program expires one year from the earlier of the date you receive the Promotional Credit code or when we deposit the Promotional Credit in your AWS account. Promotional Credit provided under the Cloud Credits for Nonprofits Program can only be provided to AWS accounts registered with the nonprofit institution’s domain name. Your AWS contracting entity is permitted to use your name and likeness in furtherance of the Cloud Credits for Nonprofits Program and to identify you as a Promotional Credit recipient and AWS customer.

(b) Promotional Credit provided under the AWS Cloud Credits for Research Program expires one year from the earlier of the date you receive the Promotional Credit code or when we deposit the Promotional Credit in your AWS account. Promotional Credit provided under the AWS Cloud Credits for Research Program can only be used to support academic research or research-focused projects. Promotional Credit provided under the AWS Cloud Credits for Research Program cannot be used for internal administrative workloads. Your AWS contracting entity is permitted to use your name and likeness in furtherance of the AWS Cloud Credits for Research Program and to identify you as a Promotional Credit recipient and AWS customer.

(c)  If you are provided Promotional Credit for a specific scope or purpose agreed between you and AWS (a “Project”), your use of Promotional Credit is subject to these terms and any agreement between you and AWS regarding the Project, and will be used only to support the Project. If you provide any estimates or Project work scope to AWS in connection with the Project, you warrant that they are accurate to the best of your knowledge.  If you agree to Project milestones, Promotional Credit is conditioned on their completion, as confirmed by AWS (unless otherwise agreed by AWS). To the extent permitted by applicable law, and upon AWS’s reasonable request, you will provide details relating to progress on the Project, which you consent to AWS and its affiliates using to administer AWS’s support of the Project.  In the event of a conflict between this Section 10(c) and any separate agreement between you and AWS regarding the Project, the terms of that separate agreement will govern.

(1) If you are executing the Project for the direct benefit, or at the direction, of any entity that is a part of, or is substantially owned, funded, managed, or controlled by, any government at any level, including any public educational institution (a “Government Entity”), you will disclose in writing to the Government Entity that AWS is supporting your Project with Promotional Credit (including the amount). Any Promotional Credit provided by AWS in connection with such Project is provided for the Government Entity’s benefit to offset its costs associated with the Project. You may not retain or use any portion of the Promotional Credit for your own benefit. You must pass on the full value of the Promotional Credit to the Government Entity as a discount for the work performed under the Project. You will take appropriate measures (such as confirming with the Government Entity’s contracting officer, ethics official, or other applicable Government Entity’s representative) to ensure that your use of Promotional Credit is lawful, ethical, and permissible, does not create any conflict of interest for you or AWS, and does not improperly influence your objectivity, including where a Government Entity expects you to provide objective recommendations or suggestions relating to cloud services. By accepting Promotional Credit, you consent to AWS disclosing its support of the Project to the Government Entity.

11. You agree to maintain in strict confidence any data or information relating to the Service Offerings that you discover, derive, develop, or otherwise learn about through your use of the Service Offerings. This includes, but is not limited to, data or information relating to the Service Offering’s security and any suggested improvements to the Service Offerings.   

12. We may modify these Terms at any time by posting a revised version on the AWS Site or by sending you an email using the email address provided in your application for Promotional Credit. The modified Terms will become effective upon posting or, if we notify you by email, as stated in the email message. By receiving or using Promotional Credit after the effective date of any modification to these Terms, you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. We last modified these Terms on the date listed at the top of this page.

13. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, if you redeem a Promotional Credit code or otherwise use Promotional Credit on an AWS account with an affiliate of Amazon Web Services, Inc. as your AWS contracting entity under your Agreement, the Promotional Credit will be deemed to be offered by that affiliate and references to “AWS,” “your AWS contracting entity,” “us,” “our,” and “we” will be references to that affiliate
